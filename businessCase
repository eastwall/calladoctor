The process of defining the business need, analyzing the situation, making recommendations, and defining evaluation
criteria is applicable to any organization’s projects. A business case may include but is not limited to documenting
the following:
uu Business needs:
nuDetermination of what is prompting the need for action;
nuSituational statement documenting the business problem or opportunity to be addressed including the value
to be delivered to the organization;
nuIdentification of stakeholders affected; and
nuIdentification of the scope.
uu Analysis of the situation:
nuIdentification of organizational strategies, goals, and objectives;
nuIdentification of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an opportunity;
nuGap analysis of capabilities needed for the project versus existing capabilities of the organization;
nuIdentification of known risks;
nuIdentification of critical success factors;
nuIdentification of decision criteria by which the various courses of action may be assessed;
Examples of criteria categories used for analysis of a situation are:
muRequired. This is a criterion that is “required” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
muDesired. This is a criterion that is “desired” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
muOptional. This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulfillment of this criterion may become a differentiator
between alternative courses of action.
nuIdentification of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options
are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as
business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:
muDo nothing. This is also referred to as the “business as usual” option. Selection of this option results in the
project not being authorized.
muDo the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. The minimum may be established
by identifying the set of documented criteria that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity.
muDo more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. This option meets the
minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of
these options documented in the business case.

uu Recommendation:
nuA statement of the recommended option to pursue in the project;
nuItems to include in the statement may include but are not limited to:
muAnalysis results for the potential option;
muConstraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies for the potential options;
and
muSuccess measures (see Section 1.2.6.4).
nuAn implementation approach that may include but is not limited to:
muMilestones,
muDependencies, and
muRoles and responsibilities.
uu Evaluation:
nuStatement describing the plan for measuring benefits the project will deliver. This should include any ongoing
operational aspects of the recommended option beyond initial implementation.



The benefits management plan
describes key elements of the benefits and may include but is not limited to documenting the following:
uu Target benefits (e.g., the expected tangible and intangible value to be gained by the implementation of the
project; financial value is expressed as net present value);
uu Strategic alignment (e.g., how well the project benefits align to the business strategies of the organization);
uu Timeframe for realizing benefits (e.g., benefits by phase, short-term, long-term, and ongoing);
uu Benefits owner (e.g., the accountable person to monitor, record, and report realized benefits throughout the
timeframe established in the plan);
uu Metrics (e.g., the measures to be used to show benefits realized, direct measures, and indirect measures);
uu Assumptions (e.g., factors expected to be in place or to be in evidence); and
uu Risks (e.g., risks for realization of benefits).
